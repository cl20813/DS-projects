## Exercise : Travelers Insurance Conversion Modeling (Update Dec.2024)
The goal of the project is to predict the probability that a prospect consumer will choose Travelers as their insurer.

Last AUC score for probability prediction is 0.8015 and recall for convertors (class 1) was 0.77 using the LightGBM.(12-28-2024). 

Tabnet showed good AUC score but it performed very poorly on predicting actual labels. Another observation is that, CNN is good for spatial, sequential data and not a good tool for analyzing tabular, well structured data.

1. Perform base modeling to compare basic models: CNN, LightGBM, and linear models.
2. Conduct feature engineering. -[Feature Engineering](trav/data_engineering_lightgbm.ipynb)  
3. Optimize hyperparameters using Rutgers HPC computing resources.   
4. Refine feature engineering.  
5. Re-tune the hyperparameters.

The final modeling result is shwon below.

## Exercise 1: Spotify genre classification using random forest.
  1. Remove duplicated rows, columns with high-entropy features.
  2. Missing values: use mean for continous and mode for categorical features.
  3. Box cox (postive data only) or yeojohnson transformation to make features more normal.
  4. Remove extreme values or outliers.
  5. Split data into train and test.
  6. Random forest, lowest auc score is 92 for 5 labels in genre.

## Exercise 2. NLP with Python: Spam detection.

  1. Read a text-based dataset into pandas: If I have a raw data, I would have to remove redundant columns other than 'label', and 'message'.
  2. Text pre processing: 1) Remove common words, ('the','a', etc...) by using NLTK library. 2) Remove punctuation (!@#$%).
  3. Use Countervectorizer to convert text into a matrix of token counts.
  4. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Spam messages tend to have lesser characters.
  5. Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifer is suitable for classification with discrete features(word counts), note that it requires **integer** feature counts.
  6. We can examine type 1 error and type 2 error and AUC score.
